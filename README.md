# [:books:]()Data Structures And Algorithms

“Data Structure is **about organizing and managing data effectively** such that we can perform specific operation efficiently, while Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to be followed to reach the desired output”

* I Finished the following course [Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using  Java](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java/), and this repo contains my implementation while taking the course.
